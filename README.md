## 📌 Project Overview

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, is facing customer dissatisfaction due to delayed and incomplete deliveries. This project aims to address these issues by building a **Power BI dashboard** that tracks key supply chain performance metrics across three cities: Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Several key customers of AtliQ Mart have not renewed their annual contracts, citing poor service. The supply chain team suspects delivery delays and order incompleteness as potential causes. To proactively address these issues and prepare for expansion to other cities, AtliQ Mart has requested a dashboard to monitor:

- ✅ On-Time Delivery (%OT)
- ✅ In-Full Delivery (%IF)
- ✅ On-Time In-Full Delivery (%OTIF)

| OT%   | 59.03% | 65.91%   | -6.88%   |
